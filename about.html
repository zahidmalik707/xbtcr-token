    <h1>About XBTCR</h1>
    <p class="desc">
      XBTCR is a next-generation cryptocurrency built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), designed to empower the community with true decentralization, fairness, and financial opportunity. Unlike traditional tokens, XBTCR enforces zero tax, no developer wallet allocations, and no pre-sale traps. The project started as a vision to provide an accessible and borderless asset that anyone can trust and verify transparently on-chain.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
      With an original supply of 100 trillion tokens, 99 trillion were sent to the burn address in a public transaction, ensuring a reduced, fixed, and verifiable circulating supply of only 1 trillion tokens. The goal is to create a long-lasting, community-owned token where users are truly in control.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
      The XBTCR ecosystem prioritizes community input, real use cases, fair trading, and growth through transparency and engagement. It is open for everyone — from new investors to experienced crypto holders — offering a safe space in the decentralized financial world.
