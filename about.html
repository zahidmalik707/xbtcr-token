    <h1>About XBTCR</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>XBTCR is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with the mission to empower holders and eliminate common risks in meme token launches. Born from the community's need for transparency and simplicity, XBTCR was created with no private sale, no presale, and no team allocation.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to bring a fair, simple, and safe experience for every crypto investor, especially those who have faced rug pulls or misleading projects. XBTCR represents a token with no gimmicks — no hidden tax, no misleading promises, and no complex tokenomics.</p>

    <p>The final circulating supply is fixed at 1 trillion tokens after burning 99 trillion from the original supply. This burn was done publicly and transparently, with proof available on BscScan. The token is already trading live on PancakeSwap V2 with 0% tax and a fully functional slippage of just 2% for smooth trading.</p>

    <p>We strongly believe that decentralization doesn't have to mean chaos. XBTCR operates without a central authority, but our roadmap and community values ensure progress, trust, and engagement at every step. Token liquidity was added manually by the creator and the project continues to grow organically.</p>

    <p>The XBTCR project is completely open-source and community-run. There are no special privileges for any wallet, no minting functions, and no backdoors in the code. The contract has been verified and is publicly visible on BscScan under the contract address: <strong>0x4274c09719F4eb538682F74DB27f7DB6DE330cd9</strong>.</p>

    <p>We maintain active communication with our holders and community through Twitter, Telegram, and future social media channels. Our focus remains on long-term adoption and real-world usability. Utilities may be introduced in future roadmap phases, but we are committed to staying honest and grounded in what we promise.</p>

    <p>Our simple motto is: <strong>"No tricks, no tax, just trust."</strong> Every holder of XBTCR is equal — whether you hold 1 token or 1 billion. Together, we build value, community, and strength.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being part of XBTCR.</p>
