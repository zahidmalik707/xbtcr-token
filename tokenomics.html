    <h1>Tokenomics</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>The tokenomics of XBTCR are designed with transparency, simplicity, and fairness at the core. Below is a detailed breakdown of our token structure and distribution approach to ensure the safety and satisfaction of every investor.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 100 Trillion (originally created)</li>
      <li><strong>Burned Supply:</strong> 99 Trillion tokens burned and sent to the dead wallet (0x000...dEaD), permanently removing them from circulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Circulating Supply:</strong> 1 Trillion XBTCR tokens — this is the total available supply for holders and traders.</li>
      <li><strong>Decimals:</strong> 18</li>
      <li><strong>Contract Address:</strong> 0x4274c09719F4eb538682F74DB27f7DB6DE330cd9 (verified on BscScan)</li>
      <li><strong>Slippage:</strong> Recommended 2% (to ensure smooth buy/sell on PancakeSwap V2)</li>
      <li><strong>Transaction Tax:</strong> 0% — there are no buy or sell taxes, ensuring pure market-driven value.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Initially added manually to PancakeSwap V2, with community control and no locked central authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why This Tokenomics?</strong></p>
    <p>We believe the best tokenomics are those that empower the community rather than drain it. With 0% tax and no developer wallets holding hidden reserves, XBTCR stands apart from typical meme tokens that hide behind complex fee structures. Our structure makes it easier for holders to participate freely without fear of high slippage or hidden fees.</p>

    <p><strong>Burn Transparency:</strong></p>
    <p>The 99 trillion token burn was done publicly with full traceable proof on BscScan. This burn reduces inflation risk and adds scarcity to the remaining 1 trillion tokens, increasing long-term holder confidence.</p>

    <p><strong>Fair Launch:</strong></p>
    <p>XBTCR was launched without any presale, private sale, or early team allocation. All tokens are publicly tradable from day one. The aim is to create a truly decentralized experience for everyone — where community and organic growth define value, not manipulation.</p>

    <p><strong>Future Utilities:</strong></p>
    <p>While we currently operate as a meme/community token, future plans include integration into staking, utility platforms, and web3 tools — all while maintaining our commitment to fair and open token distribution.</p>

    <p>In summary, the tokenomics of XBTCR are built for sustainability, simplicity, and community. Whether you’re an investor, holder, or believer in decentralized assets — XBTCR is made for you.</p>
